### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github profile.
Software Engineer

I am a dedicated and adaptable professional with a strong passion for technology, communication and innovation. As I approach the final semester of my Bachelor's degree in Software Engineering, I bring over three years of diverse experience in data management, web development and business development across various industries.

I have successfully completed two frontend web development internships, where I collaborated within Agile teams to design and implement features that enhance user experiences, using tools such as Webflow, Figma, JavaScript, TypeScript and React. 

Currently, I am looking for opportunities to further expand my technical knowledge, grow and learn from experienced professionals, while making meaningful contributions to innovative projects.

- ðŸŒŽ I'm from Brazil and I live in Germany.
