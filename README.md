### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to my Github profile.
Software Engineer

Brazilian professional living in Germany, successfully completed my first internship, where I worked for 5 months with TypeScript and React. I am curious and courageous, having made the decision to relocate to Germany from Brazil in January 2015, seeking more opportunities to grow and learn.

Driven by a profound interest in technology and communication, I discovered my enthusiasm for web development. With experience in creation, design, and marketing, coupled with the motivation to contribute to Frontend or Full Stack Development, I am eager to dive deeper into Programming and Development and learn more from experienced professionals.

- ðŸŒŽ I'm from Brazil and I live in Germany.
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning Kotlin
